**Optimal Algorithms for Covering A Rectangle with Identical Circles (2023)**

The paper introduces two quadratic time algorithms to solve two variants of the problem. The first algorithm computes the configurations or positions of the circles to cover the rectangle provided the circles cannot overlap. The second algorithm computes the same for the problem variant where the circles can overlap.
