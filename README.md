## 🌐 Personal Interests

- Outside the world of tech, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills.

- I also love traveling ✈️. In 2023, I explored the beautiful landscapes of Bhutan 🏞️. Excited about my upcoming trip in Feb 2024 to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, exploring the beauty of Central Asia! 🗺️
